Hallo, this is Dida En.

I make this web with CodeIgniter 3 in PHP 7.2 environment.

If you are gonna fork this repo, you need to follow these :

1. Download the database on assets/db
2. Go to application/config/database.php dan change the database information
3. Set up smtp_host, smtp_user, and smtp_pass in Auth::_sendMail() to your own to enable register and forgot password feature
4. Use username : physicsyourself and password : 123456 to login
5. Change the email in table 'user' to your own to send forgot password email to your email

Send me an email if you have any question.

Thank you.
