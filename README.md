LlHello, this is Dida En.

I make this web using CodeIgniter 3 in PHP 7.2 environment.

If you are going to fork this repo, you need to follow this :

1. Download the database on assets/db
2. Go to application/config/database.php and change the database information
3. Set up smtp_host, smtp_user, and smtp_pass in Auth::_sendMail() to your own to enable register and forgot password feature
4. Use username : physicsyourself and password : 123456 to log in
5. Change the email in table 'user' on the database to your own to send forgot password email to your email

Let me know if you have any questions by sending me an email.

Thank you.
